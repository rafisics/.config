**Project-specific structure**: See `.claude/context/repo/project-overview.md` for details about this repository's layout.

**New repository setup**: If project-overview.md doesn't exist or contains the generic template notice (`<!-- GENERIC TEMPLATE`), run `/project-overview` to interactively scan the repository and create a generation task. See `.claude/context/repo/update-project.md` for guidance.

## Task Management

### Status Markers
- `[NOT STARTED]` - Initial state
- `[RESEARCHING]` -> `[RESEARCHED]` - Research phase
- `[PLANNING]` -> `[PLANNED]` - Planning phase
- `[IMPLEMENTING]` -> `[PR READY]` -> `[COMPLETED]` - Implementation + PR phase
- `[PR READY]` -> `[IMPLEMENTING]` - If PR review finds issues (re-dispatch)
- `[BLOCKED]`, `[ABANDONED]`, `[PARTIAL]`, `[EXPANDED]` - Terminal/exception states

### Artifact Paths
```
specs/{NNN}_{SLUG}/
├── reports/MM_{short-slug}.md
├── plans/MM_{short-slug}.md
└── summaries/MM_{short-slug}-summary.md
```
`{NNN}` = 3-digit zero-padded task directory numbers, `{DATE}` = YYYYMMDD.

**Naming Convention**: Artifacts use `MM_{short-slug}.md` format:
- `MM` = Zero-padded sequence number within task (01, 02, 03...)
- `{short-slug}` = 3-5 word kebab-case description extracted from task title
- Examples: `01_configure-lsp-python.md`, `02_implementation-plan.md`, `03_execution-summary.md`

**Note**: Task numbers remain unpadded (`{N}`) in TODO.md entries, state.json values, and commit messages. Only directory names and artifact sequence numbers use zero-padding for lexicographic sorting.

**System-Specific Naming**: Task directories use different prefixes by system:
- **Claude Code** (.claude/): `specs/{NNN}_{SLUG}/` (no prefix)
- **OpenCode** (.opencode/): `specs/OC_{NNN}_{SLUG}/` (OC_ prefix)

This distinction enables identification of which system created each task.

### Task-Type-Based Routing

**Core Task Types** (always available):

| Task Type | Research Skill | Implementation Skill | Tools |
|-----------|----------------|---------------------|-------|
| `general` | `skill-researcher` | `skill-implementer` | WebSearch, WebFetch, Read, Write, Edit, Bash |
| `meta` | `skill-researcher` | `skill-implementer` | Read, Grep, Glob, Write, Edit |
| `markdown` | `skill-researcher` | `skill-implementer` | Read, Write, Edit |

**Extension Task Types** (available when extensions are loaded via the extension picker):

Extensions provide additional task type support (lean4, latex, typst, python, nix, web, z3, epi, formal, founder, present, etc.). See `.claude/extensions/*/manifest.json` for available extensions and their capabilities.

When an extension is loaded, its routing entries are merged into the command tables and context index.

Extensions can declare dependencies on other extensions via the `dependencies` array in manifest.json. Dependencies are auto-loaded silently when the parent extension is loaded, with circular detection and a depth limit of 5. See `.claude/context/guides/extension-development.md` for details.

Extensions may also declare lifecycle hooks in a top-level `hooks` object in `manifest.json` (distinct from `provides.hooks` which are file-copy targets). Hook scripts run at skill lifecycle stages (preflight, context_injection, verification, postflight) via `skill-base.sh`. See `.claude/docs/guides/creating-extensions.md#lifecycle-hooks` for the hook schema and execution contract.

Extensions can register `keyword_overrides` in their manifest.json to automatically detect their task type from keywords in the task description during `/task` creation. See `.claude/context/guides/extension-development.md` for the keyword_overrides schema.

## Command Reference

All commands use checkpoint-based execution: GATE IN (preflight) -> DELEGATE (skill/agent) -> GATE OUT (postflight) -> COMMIT.

| Command | Usage | Description |
|---------|-------|-------------|
| `/task` | `/task "Description"` | Create task |
| `/task` | `/task --recover N`, `--expand N`, `--sync`, `--abandon N` | Manage tasks |
| `/research` | `/research N[,N-N] [focus] [--team] [--clean] [--lit] [--fast\|--hard] [--haiku\|--sonnet\|--opus]` | Research task(s), route by task type |
| `/plan` | `/plan N[,N-N] [--team] [--clean] [--lit] [--fast\|--hard] [--haiku\|--sonnet\|--opus]` | Create implementation plan(s) |
| `/implement` | `/implement N[,N-N] [--team] [--force] [--clean] [--lit] [--fast\|--hard] [--haiku\|--sonnet\|--opus]` | Execute plan(s), resume from incomplete phase |
| `/revise` | `/revise N` | Create new plan version |
| `/review` | `/review` | Analyze codebase |
| `/project-overview` | `/project-overview` | Interactive repo scan and project-overview.md generation |
| `/todo` | `/todo` | Archive completed/abandoned tasks, sync repository metrics |
| `/errors` | `/errors` | Analyze error patterns, create fix plans |
| `/meta` | `/meta` | System builder for .claude/ changes |
| `/fix-it` | `/fix-it [PATH...]` | Scan for FIX:/NOTE:/TODO:/QUESTION: tags |
| `/refresh` | `/refresh [--dry-run] [--force]` | Clean orphaned processes and old files |
| `/tag` | `/tag [--patch|--minor|--major]` | Create semantic version tag (user-only) |
| `/orchestrate` | `/orchestrate N [--lit]` | Drive task autonomously through full lifecycle (no confirmation gates) |
| `/spawn` | `/spawn N [blocker description]` | Spawn new tasks to unblock a blocked task |
| `/merge` | `/merge` | Create pull/merge request for current branch (user-only) |
| `/literature` | `/literature` | Show specs/literature/ status and index health |
| `/literature` | `/literature --scan` | Scan for unprocessed PDFs/DJVUs |
| `/literature` | `/literature --convert [FILE]` | Convert PDF/DJVU to markdown with chunking |
| `/literature` | `/literature --validate` | Validate index.json against filesystem |
| `/literature` | `/literature --index FILE` | Add/update index entry for existing markdown file |
| `/literature` | `/literature --search "QUERY"` | Search Zotero library and Literature/ index by keyword |
| `/literature` | `/literature --task N` | Extract task N description as search query |

**Multi-task syntax**: `/research`, `/plan`, and `/implement` accept multiple task numbers using commas and ranges (e.g., `/research 7, 22-24, 59`). Each task is processed by a separate agent in parallel. Flags like `--team` and `--force` apply to all tasks. See `.claude/context/patterns/multi-task-operations.md` for the full specification.

### Utility Scripts

- `.claude/scripts/export-to-markdown.sh` - Export .claude/ directory to consolidated markdown file
- `.claude/scripts/check-extension-docs.sh` - Doc-lint: validate extension READMEs, manifests, and cross-references (exits non-zero on failures)

## State Synchronization

TODO.md is generated from state.json. Update state.json first, then call `bash .claude/scripts/generate-todo.sh` to regenerate TODO.md. The `update-task-status.sh` script calls `generate-todo.sh` internally, so explicit calls are only needed after manual state.json edits.

### state.json Structure
```json
{
  "next_project_number": 1,
  "default_task_type": null,
  "active_projects": [{
    "project_number": 1,
    "project_name": "task_slug",
    "status": "planned",
    "task_type": "general",
    "completion_summary": "Required when status=completed",
    "roadmap_items": ["Optional explicit roadmap items"]
  }],
  "repository_health": {
    "last_assessed": "ISO8601 timestamp",
    "status": "healthy"
  }
}
```

**`default_task_type`** (optional, null by default): When set to a non-null string, overrides the keyword table in `/task` step 4 for all new tasks in this project. Meta keywords ("meta", "agent", "command", "skill") always resolve to `meta` regardless of this field. Precedence: meta keywords > extension `keyword_overrides` > `default_task_type` > keyword table > `general`.

### Completion Workflow
- Non-meta tasks: `completion_summary` + optional `roadmap_items` -> /todo annotates ROADMAP.md
- Meta tasks: `completion_summary` only (CLAUDE.md is auto-generated from merge-sources)

### Vault Operation (Task Number Reset)

When `next_project_number` exceeds 1000, the `/todo` command initiates vault archival:

1. **Trigger**: `next_project_number > 1000` detected during /todo execution
2. **User Confirmation**: AskUserQuestion with renumbering preview
3. **Vault Creation**: Move `specs/archive/` to `specs/vault/{NN-vault}/`
4. **Renumbering**: Tasks > 1000 renumbered by subtracting 1000 (e.g., 1003 -> 3)
5. **State Reset**: `next_project_number` set to max(renumbered) + 1

**Vault Fields** in state.json:
- `vault_count`: Number of completed vault operations
- `vault_history`: Array of vault metadata entries

See `.claude/rules/state-management.md` for complete vault schema documentation.

## Git Commit Conventions

Format: `task {N}: {action}` with session ID in body.
```
task 1: complete research

Session: sess_1736700000_abc123
```

Standard actions: `create`, `complete research`, `create implementation plan`, `phase {P}: {name}`, `complete implementation`.

### Agents

| Agent | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| general-research-agent | General web/codebase research |
| general-implementation-agent | General file implementation |
| planner-agent | Implementation plan creation |
| meta-builder-agent | System building and meta tasks |
| code-reviewer-agent | Code quality assessment and review |
| reviser-agent | Plan revision with research synthesis |
| spawn-agent | Blocker analysis and task decomposition |
| synthesis-agent | Multi-output synthesis for team research and team planning |
| general-research-hard-agent | Hard-mode research with adversarial self-verification and reference grounding |
| planner-hard-agent | Hard-mode planning with phase sizing constraints and postmortem rules |
| general-implementation-hard-agent | Hard-mode implementation with anti-analysis contracts and per-phase focus |

**Model Enforcement**: Agents declare preferred models via `model:` frontmatter field using a tiered policy: Opus for deep-reasoning agents (planner, meta-builder, reviser, formal/lean/math/logic) AND for orchestrator commands (`/research`, `/plan`, `/implement`) which accumulate large context across sequential sub-agent calls and require the 1M context auto-upgrade; Sonnet for worker agents (research, implementation, review, spawn, domain tasks) which have their own fresh context per invocation. Two independent flag dimensions override behavior at invocation time: effort flags (`--fast`, `--hard`) control reasoning depth, and model flags (`--haiku`, `--sonnet`, `--opus`) select the model family. These flags work on `/research`, `/plan`, and `/implement`. See `.claude/docs/reference/standards/agent-frontmatter-standard.md` for details.

**User-Only Skills**: Skills marked as "user-only" cannot be invoked by agents. These are for human-controlled operations like deployment (`skill-tag`).

**Extension Skills**: When extensions are loaded, additional skill-to-agent mappings are added (e.g., skill-{domain}-research -> {domain}-research-agent). Extension task types use bare values (e.g., `python`) or compound values (e.g., `present:grant`) for sub-routing.

**Team Mode Skills**: When `--team` flag is passed to `/research`, `/plan`, or `/implement`, routing overrides to team skills which spawn multiple parallel teammates. Requires `CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS=1` environment variable. Gracefully degrades to single-agent if unavailable.

| Flag | Team Skill | Teammates | Purpose |
|------|------------|-----------|---------|
| `--team` | skill-team-research | 2-4 | Parallel investigation with synthesis |
| `--team` | skill-team-plan | 2-3 | Parallel plan generation with trade-offs |
| `--team` | skill-team-implement | 2-4 | Parallel phase execution with debugger |

**Note**: Team mode uses ~5x tokens compared to single-agent. Default team_size=3 (Primary + Alternatives + Critic). Use `--fast` for 2 or `--hard` for 4.

## Hard Mode (`--hard`)

Hard mode encodes behavioral contracts distilled from high-complexity task orchestration (BimodalLogic task-273 baseline: 9 H-techniques, measured outcome: 0 lines -> 2,400+ lines across 13 dispatches).

### What Hard Mode Does

Hard mode activates a set of behavioral contracts and routing changes:
- **Anti-analysis (H2)**: Strict read budget, forbidden analysis-only outputs, defect bar enforcement
- **Reference grounding (H3)**: Source-to-implementation mapping with tier selection (literature/docs/code)
- **Adversarial verification (H4)**: Research output verified before plan dispatch
- **Divergence audit (H5)**: Three-strikes on any target triggers dedicated audit dispatch
- **Convergence policing (H6)**: Churn detection with per-target counters
- **Territory contracts (H7)**: Parallel dispatch with explicit file ownership
- **Phase sizing (H8)**: Each phase bounded to one agent run (~100-500 lines output)
- **Wrap-up discipline (H9)**: Orchestrator handoff JSON + incremental commits at every green milestone

### When to Use `--hard`

Use `--hard` when one or more of the following apply:

1. **2+ plan versions exist** for the same task without convergence
2. **Previous dispatches produced analysis-only output** with no file writes (analysis-paralysis signal)
3. **Task involves formal verification** (lean4, z3) requiring faithful transcription of mathematical sources
4. **Task involves literature-based implementation** (paper to code, spec to implementation)
5. **Task has been in [IMPLEMENTING] for 3+ dispatch cycles** without phase completion
6. **Task description contains "deflection" or "stuck"** indicators in /errors output

### Cost Impact

| Mode | Cost Multiplier |
|------|----------------|
| Standard | 1x |
| `--hard` | ~3-5x |
| `--team` | ~5x |
| `--hard --team` | ~15-25x |

### Composability

- `--hard` works with `--team`: team skills inject hard-mode contracts into each teammate
- `--hard` works with model flags: `--hard --opus` uses Opus model with hard-mode contracts
- `--hard` works with extension routing: extensions declare `routing_hard` in their manifest
- Graceful fallback: commands without hard variants silently use standard behavior

### Routing Mechanism

`--hard` is resolved by `command-route-skill.sh` as a 4th `effort_flag` argument:
1. Check `routing_hard.$operation.$task_type` in extension manifests
2. If not found: construct candidate by appending `-hard` to the resolved skill name
3. If candidate skill exists (`.claude/skills/${skill}-hard/SKILL.md`): use it
4. If not: fall back to standard skill with stderr note `[route] No hard variant for $skill; using standard skill`

### Per-Invocation Only

`--hard` is a per-invocation flag only. There is no sticky hard mode or `effort_mode` field
in state.json. Each invocation of `/research`, `/plan`, `/implement`, or `/orchestrate` must
explicitly pass `--hard` to activate hard mode.

## Literature Mode (`--lit`)

Literature mode injects reference files from `specs/literature/` as `<literature-context>` into
agent prompts. Use this when a task involves implementing from a paper, specification, or
reference document.

### What `--lit` Does

When `--lit` is passed to `/research`, `/plan`, `/implement`, or `/orchestrate`:
- `literature-retrieve.sh` reads all `.md` and `.txt` files from `specs/literature/`
- Files are included up to TOKEN_BUDGET=4000 tokens (MAX_FILES=10)
- A `<literature-context>` block is injected after `<memory-context>` (if any) and before
  task-specific instructions
- If `specs/literature/` does not exist or is empty, the flag is silently ignored (no error)

### specs/literature/ Directory Convention

The `specs/literature/` directory is user-maintained and not task-scoped:
- Place paper summaries, specification documents, algorithm descriptions, or reference PDFs
  (converted to .md/.txt) here
- All files in the directory are available to any task when `--lit` is active
- The directory is not created automatically — create it before using `--lit`
- Suitable content: academic paper summaries, RFC/spec excerpts, algorithm pseudocode,
  mathematical definitions the agent should treat as ground truth

### When to Use `--lit`

- Task requires implementing from a paper or formal specification
- Agent needs stable reference material beyond what is in memory
- Using `--hard` with H3 reference grounding tier "literature"
- Task description mentions "paper to code", "spec to implementation", or cites a specific document

### Relationship to `--clean`

The two flags are independent:

| Flag combination | Memory retrieval | Literature injection |
|------------------|-----------------|---------------------|
| (neither)        | active          | inactive            |
| `--clean`        | suppressed      | inactive            |
| `--lit`          | active          | active              |
| `--clean --lit`  | suppressed      | active              |

### Composability

- `--lit` works with `--team`, `--hard`, `--fast`, and model flags
- `--lit` is threaded through all dispatch contexts in skill-orchestrate
- Per-invocation only: no sticky state in state.json

### Per-Invocation Only

`--lit` has no persistent state. Each invocation of `/research`, `/plan`, `/implement`, or
`/orchestrate` must explicitly pass `--lit` to activate literature injection.

## Rules References

Core rules (auto-applied by file path):
- @.claude/rules/state-management.md - Task state patterns (specs/**)
- @.claude/rules/git-workflow.md - Commit conventions
- @.claude/rules/error-handling.md - Error recovery (.claude/**)
- @.claude/rules/artifact-formats.md - Report/plan formats (specs/**)
- @.claude/rules/workflows.md - Command lifecycle (.claude/**)
- @.claude/rules/plan-format-enforcement.md - Plan format checklist (specs/**)

**Extension Rules**: When extensions are loaded, additional rules are added (e.g., {domain}-rules.md for domain-specific development).

## Context Discovery

Context is discovered from three independent layers, loaded in parallel:

| Layer | Source | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------|
| Agent context | `.claude/context/index.json` | Core + extensions (merged by loader) |
| Project context | `.context/index.json` | User conventions (may be empty) |
| Project memory | `.memory/` files | Loaded directly, no index needed |

```bash
# Combined adaptive query (recommended) - loads matching context from all dimensions
jq -r --arg agent "planner-agent" --arg task_type "meta" --arg cmd "/plan" '
  .entries[] | select(
    (.load_when.always == true) or
    any(.load_when.agents[]?; . == $agent) or
    any(.load_when.task_types[]?; . == $task_type) or
    any(.load_when.commands[]?; . == $cmd)
  ) | .path' .claude/context/index.json

# Get line counts for budget calculation
jq -r '.entries[] | select(.load_when.agents[]? == "planner-agent") | "\(.line_count)\t\(.path)"' .claude/context/index.json
```

**Empty Array Semantics**: Empty `load_when` arrays mean "never match". Use `"always": true` for universal files.

See `.claude/context/patterns/context-discovery.md` for full query patterns including multi-layer discovery.

**Extension Context**: Extension index entries are merged into `.claude/context/index.json` by the loader -- no separate extension query needed.

## Context Architecture

Five layers provide context to agents. Each has a distinct owner and purpose.

| Layer | Location | Owner | Contains |
|-------|----------|-------|----------|
| Agent context | `.claude/context/` | Extension loader | Core agent patterns + extension domain knowledge |
| Extensions | `.claude/extensions/*/context/` | Extension loader | Language-specific standards, tools, patterns |
| Project context | `.context/` | User (via index.json) | Project conventions not covered by extensions |
| Project memory | `.memory/` | Agents over time | Learned facts, discoveries, decisions |
| Auto-memory | `~/.claude/projects/` | Claude Code | User preferences, behavioral corrections |

### Where to store new content

```
Language-specific standard, pattern, or tool reference?
  YES --> extension context (.claude/extensions/*/context/)

Agent system pattern (orchestration, format, workflow)?
  YES --> .claude/context/

Project convention (coding style, naming, domain knowledge)?
  YES --> .context/

Learned fact from development (discovery, decision, pattern)?
  YES --> .memory/

User preference or behavioral correction?
  YES --> auto-memory (automatic, no action needed)
```

Full details: `.claude/context/architecture/context-layers.md`

## Context Imports

Core context (always available):
- @.claude/context/repo/project-overview.md
- @README.md

**Extension Context**: Available when extensions are loaded via the extension picker. Query `index.json` for extension-specific context files.

## Multi-Task Creation Standards

Commands that create multiple tasks follow a standardized 8-component pattern. See `.claude/docs/reference/standards/multi-task-creation-standard.md` for the complete specification.

**Commands Using Multi-Task Creation**:
| Command | Compliance | Notes |
|---------|------------|-------|
| `/meta` | Full (Reference) | All 8 components, Kahn's algorithm, DAG visualization |
| `/fix-it` | Full | Interactive selection, topic grouping, internal dependencies |
| `/review` | Partial | Tier-based selection, grouping; no dependencies |
| `/errors` | Partial | Automatic mode (intentional); no interactive selection |
| `/task --review` | Partial | Numbered selection, parent_task linking |

**Required Components** (all multi-task creators):
- Item Discovery - Identify potential tasks
- Interactive Selection - AskUserQuestion with multiSelect
- User Confirmation - Explicit "Yes, create tasks" before creation
- State Updates - Atomic state.json + TODO.md updates

**Optional Components** (for 3+ tasks):
- Topic Grouping - Cluster related items
- Dependency Declaration - Ask about task relationships
- Topological Sorting - Kahn's algorithm for ordering
- Visualization - Linear chain or layered DAG display

## Error Handling

- **On failure**: Keep task in current status, log to errors.json, preserve partial progress
- **On timeout**: Mark phase [PARTIAL], next /implement resumes
- **Git failures**: Non-blocking (logged, not fatal)

## jq Command Safety

Claude Code Issue #1132 causes jq parse errors when using `!=` operator (escaped as `\!=`).

**Safe pattern**: Use `select(.type == "X" | not)` instead of `select(.type != "X")`

```bash
# SAFE - use "| not" pattern
select(.type == "plan" | not)

# UNSAFE - gets escaped as \!=
select(.type != "plan")
```

Full documentation: @.claude/context/patterns/jq-escaping-workarounds.md

## Syncprotect

The `.syncprotect` file lives at the **project root** (not inside `.claude/`) and lists relative paths (one per line) of artifacts that should never be overwritten during sync operations. Lines starting with `#` are comments, blank lines are ignored. Paths are relative to the base directory (e.g., `rules/my-custom-rule.md`). Protected files are skipped during both full "Load Core" syncs and individual artifact updates via `Ctrl-l`. The picker preview shows a "Protected Files" section listing which files will be skipped.

## Important Notes

- Update status BEFORE starting work (preflight) and AFTER completing (postflight)
- state.json = machine truth, TODO.md = user visibility
- All skills use lazy context loading via @-references
- Session ID format: `sess_{timestamp}_{random}` - generated at GATE IN, included in commits
